# Hypothesis Testing Problems

This repository contains exercises for practicing hypothesis testing, specifically focusing on comparing the means of two groups to determine if there is a significant difference. The exercise provided is designed for nutritionists looking to understand if one diet has a higher impact on weight loss compared to another.

## Exercise  1: Diet Weight Loss Comparison

**Background:**
A nutritionist has conducted a one-month weight loss study comparing two different diets. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two diets and their weight loss over the month was recorded. The goal is to determine if there is a significant difference in the average weight loss between the two diets.

**Data:**

| Diet  1 | Diet  2 |
|---------|---------|
|   2.0   |   3.0   |
|   2.5   |   3.2   |
|   3.0   |   3.1   |
|   2.8   |   2.9   |
|   2.3   |   2.8   |
|   2.7   |   3.0   |
|   2.5   |   3.2   |

**Problem Statement:**
Using the data above, perform the following steps to answer the question: Is there a significant difference in average weight loss between people who followed the first diet and those who followed the second diet?

1. State the **null hypothesis (H₀)**: The second diet does not result in more weight loss than the first diet.
2. State the **alternative hypothesis (H₁)**: The second diet results in more weight loss than the first diet.
3. Perform a **Student's t-test** to test the hypothesis.
4. Analyze the results and draw conclusions.
